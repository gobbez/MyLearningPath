## Step-By-Step Learning

### Chapter 1. The Bash Shell

This first chapter starts with an introduction of the Bash Shell with its common methods. 
<br>
The book teaches how to create scripts with various functions (like receive input or writing in the files).
<br>
At the end of the chapter there is a simple exercise.
<br>
You can find some exercises in 

[Files/Chapter1](files/chapter1)

<br>

### Chapter 2. Flux control and text elaboration

This chapter explains different type of loops (while, until, for) and conditions.
<br>
Using operators and conditions to create efficient loops and save results to files or modify them.
<br>
One exercise provided some IPs to filter, extract and modify.
<br>
As always, there are lots of Bash exercises to do, that you can find in:

<br>

### Chapter 3. Creation of hacking laboratory

Here the books shows us how to instal **Docker**, **Kali Linux** and a fictional network with 8 machine (4 public and 4 private).
<br>
We will use these machines for our training in the following chapters.
<br>
The book lets us install different tools that aren't already available in Kali Linux. 
<br>
Here's a list of tools installed:
<li>Dirsearch</li>
<li>Gitjacker</li>
<li>LinEnum</li>
<li>LinuxExploitSuggester2</li>
<li>Nuclei</li>
<li>Pwncat</li>
<li>RustScan</li>
<li>unix-privesc-check</li>
<li>WhatWeb</li>

<br>

### Chapter 4. Recognition

This chapter lets us create some interesting script to extract information of our target network, such as:
<li>ip info</li>
<li>ping hosts</li>
<li>watchdog script</li>
<li>os info</li>
<li>server info</li>
<br>
There are plenty of exercises to do, where every script is found here:

<br>

### Chapter 5. Vulnerability Scanner and Fuzzing

In this super interesting chapter we continued to explore our test-network and the book guided us to create scripts for our sessions.
<br>
We used different tools to discover vulnerabilities and extracting some informations, urls and even downloading files.
<br>
The tools that we have used are:
<li>Nikto: A web server scanner</li>
<li>Nmap: Network Mapper â€” the Swiss army knife of network scanning.</li>
<li>Nuclie: A fast, customizable vulnerability scanner powered by YAML templates.</li>
<li>Wfuzz: A web fuzzer.</li>
<li>Wget: A command-line tool to download files from the web.</li>

<br>
You can find the scripts here:

<br>

### Chapter 6. Acquire a Web Shell

In this chapter we see different techniques and tools to try to install a web shell in our target.
<br>
We used the BurpSuite tool to add another app.py file to overwrite the current one in order to make us create and use a web shell.
<br>
Then, we managed to execute some bash code directly into our target-server.
