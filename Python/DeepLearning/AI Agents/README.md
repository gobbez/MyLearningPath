- LLM: Large Language Model that can par our "reasoning", meaning it's able to identify a task and create a plan and actions to solve it.
- Memory: Collections of interactions between user and ai or data to improve Agent abilities.
- Tools: Functions or API calls that we use to send information to our Agent.
