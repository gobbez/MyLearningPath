## 1. Introduction to Deep Learning

**Introduction**

The course starts by showing the differences and the rapid growth of Deep Learning capabilities.
<br>
For example, in 2015 face-generating models were able to create an opaque black and white image and in 2020 they were able to create a short videoclip of Obama talking about the MIT course. However, that short videoclip costed 50+ hours of videos and 15k+ hardware, meaning that:

**Deep Learning is evolving fast, but the hardware cost is also as important**

Then, Alexander showed the present days: 2025. While speaking, he had a script that was registering his voice and it used that to create a Deep Learning model able to speak similarly to him.

**What is Artificial Intelligence?**

<li>AI is any technique that makes the computer do the same thing done by a human.</li>
<li>Machine Learning is the ability (of the computer) to learn without being specifically programmed.</li>
<li>Deep Learning is extracting patterns from data using Neural Networks</li>
