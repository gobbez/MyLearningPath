# University of Padova - Scientific Computing in Python

This 100h course, held by University of Padova on EduOpen platform has the objective of teaching Scientific Computing using Python language.
<br>
The course teaches math with vector data, algorithms and their validation with numerical sperimentation. There will be excercises and practical examples (using code) for matrix calculus and its efficiency, plot interpretation, math model simulations, performance enhanching with paralel computing using GPU.
<br>

### Objectives
<li>Program algorithms for scientific calculation using Python/Numpy</li>
<li>Perform numerical sperimentation and evaluating performances</li>
<li>Show plots of data and multi-dimensional results</li>
<li>Create parallel computing algorithms for linear algebra using GPU</li>
