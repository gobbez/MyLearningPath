## 1. What are AI Agents?

AI Agents mix a LLM, memory and tools to create a connection with the user in order how to deal and solve user tasks.
<br>
This first lesson shows the AI Agent parts and an overview of the code (that you can find on the above-mentioned Github repo).

- LLM: Large Language Model that can par our "reasoning", meaning it's able to identify a task and create a plan and actions to solve it.
- Memory: Collections of interactions between user and ai or data to improve Agent abilities.
- Tools: Functions or API calls that we use to send information to our Agent.


## 2. How can AI Agents improve?

This chapter explains what is Metacognition, sumarizing it as the process of saving and storing user preferences and adding more informations as the conversation goes on.
<br>
So the "memory" of the AI Agent must always be filled with new information and also, it must be re-called for each interaction to make the AI Agent always pertinent with the context of the message.
<br>
Some code examples are shown too, to explain an interaction by a user that wants to book a flight and the AI Agent that asks questions and saves informations.
